Here are three examples related to the lecture: Modern Approaches to Time Series Processing with Neural Networks: From RNNs to Transformers. <br/>
Example 1: Time Series Forecasting with RNNs in Python. Problem Statement: Given a sequence of temperature data for several days, we need to build an RNN model that will predict the temperature of the next day based on previous measurements. <br/>
Example 2: Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs in Python. <br/>
Example 3: Applying GRUs to Forecasting Time Series of Commodity Prices. In this case, we will use GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) to forecast time series of prices. We will take synthetic data that mimics commodity prices and train a GRU model to predict the next price values ​​based on previous measurements. <br/>
